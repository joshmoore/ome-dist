OMERO.grid Application Descriptions
-----------------------------------

This directory contains application descriptions for OMERO.grid.
These files define what applications are started on what hosts within
your network, and so are key to securing your infrastructure.

All examples assume that processes will be run from the OMERO_HOME directory.
This simplifies deployment, but is less secure since this directory may not
belong to you. To further secure your installation, make all path references
absolute.

See http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5.2/sysadmins/grid.html for
more information.
